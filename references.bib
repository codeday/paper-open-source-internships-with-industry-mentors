	abstract = {Professional development is critical for preparing undergraduate {CS} students for their future careers. Industry internships offer students pathways for professional development. However, little is empirically known about the impact industry-based internships have on {CS} students' career paths as well as the effectiveness of {CS} degree programs in preparing students for these professional development opportunities. In this paper, we present a thematic analysis of open-ended survey responses of 40 {CS} undergraduate students in the {US} who participated in an internship. This study aimed to understand the impact that professional internships have on: {CS} students' career goals, students' perceptions of the gaps between academia and industry, and students' strategies for professional success. We found four themes that describe the impact of internships on {CS} students. Internships (1) strengthened students' commitment to {CS} degrees and careers; (2) encouraged exploration of {CS} careers and industries; (3) promoted personal/professional growth; and (4) developed awareness of professional expectations. We also analyzed students' perception of the curriculum's effectiveness and found that students were strategically working to improve their technical skills outside of coursework to secure employment. These findings have the potential to retain students in computing and reduce the gaps between academia and industry, thereby increasing {CS} students' competitiveness in the workforce.},

This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review conducted to determine which areas graduating students most frequently fall short of the expectations of industry or macademia. The results of this review indicate that graduating students are lacking in many different areas, including technical abilities (design, testing, configuration management tools, etc.) personal skills (communication, teamwork, etc.) and professional qualities (e.g. ethics). By raising awareness of these areas, it is possible for educators to become aware of areas where students most frequently fail to meet expectations and to make curriculum changes or adjustments to address these problems},

The lack of these skills and abilities can limit the productivity of newly hired, recent graduates, or even prevent them from gaining employment. This paper presents the results of an empirical study where twenty-three managers and hiring personnel from various software companies in the United States and Europe were interviewed. Participants were asked about areas where recent graduates frequently struggled when beginning employment at their companies and which skill deficiencies might prevent a recent graduate from being hired. The results of this study indicate that recent graduates struggle with using configuration management systems (and other software tools), effectively communicating with co-workers and customers, producing unit tests for their code, and other skills or abilities. The results also indicate that a lack of project experience and problem solving abilities are the most commonly cited issues preventing students from gaining employment. This research is intended to assist educators in identifying areas where students may not measure up the expectations of industry companies and in improving the curriculum at their universities to better prepare them for their future careers.},

This study identified faculty views on the goals of an undergraduate education and a {CS} major, focusing on preparation for careers in industry. In order to identify a spectrum of faculty views, we interviewed 14 faculty from a variety of backgrounds across three institutions.

The research is partly motivated by the desire to increase female participation rates in {CS}, particularly in the {UK}. Policymakers can use the factors that both females and males identify as influencing their choice of studying {CS} to enhance the experiences of all students prior to coming to university, but female students in particular. The study uses a semi-structured interview with 17 mixed gender subjects currently studying {CS} at three Scottish universities. The findings are that social support from family, teachers, friends and mentors is a particularly important factor in choosing to study {CS}, especially for female subjects. The career paths offered by a {CS} degree is another major factor, not just the potential jobs, but also the general value of a {CS} education and the potential to make useful contributions to society. School education appeared to have limited influence, though exposure to problem solving, programming, online self-learning and internships are positive influences. The stereotypical view of {CS} students as 'geeks' is outdated and unhelpful - it is more appropriate to see them as 'analytical' or 'over-achievers'. Subjects make many suggestions for improving the {CS} education provided at school, especially to make it more attractive to females, including: make it compulsory, teach it earlier, include more programming and problem solving, and increase the visibility of female exemplars and role models.},

However, it is important that any employment‐related developments and initiatives are informed by the opinions and experiences of present and former students. This paper addresses this need by comparing the undergraduate career expectations and post‐graduation career experiences of geography students from the University of Plymouth.

To attain this goal, some policymakers have targeted reducing {STEM} attrition in college, arguing that retaining more students in {STEM} fields in college is a low-cost, fast way to produce   the {STEM} professionals that the nation needs (President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology [{PCAST}] 2012). Within this context, this Statistical Analysis Report ({SAR}) presents an examination ofstudents’ attrition from {STEM} fields over the course of 6 years in college using data from the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study ({BPS}:04/09) and the associated 2009 Postsecondary Education Transcript Study ({PETS}:09). In this {SAR}, the term {STEM} attrition refers to enrollment choices that result in potential {STEM} graduates (i.e., undergraduates who declare a {STEM} major) moving away from {STEM} fields by switching majors to non-{STEM} fields or leaving postsecondary education before earning a degree or certificate.1 The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of this attrition by: •determining rates of attrition from {STEM} and non-{STEM} fields; •identifying characteristics of students who leave {STEM} fields;•comparing the {STEM} coursetaking and performance of {STEM} leavers and persisters; and•examining the strength of various factors’ associations with {STEM} attrition.Data from a cohort of students who started their postsecondary education in a bachelor’s or associate’s degree program in the 2003−04 academic year were used to examine students’ movement into and out of {STEM} fields over the subsequent6 years through 2009. Analyses were performed separately for beginning bachelor’s and associate’s degree students. For brevity, these two groups are frequently referred to as bachelor’s or associate’s degree students in this study. Selected findings from this {SAR} are described below.},

Representatives from industry can serve as guest lecturers, curriculum advisors, and design project sponsors and team mentors. Since 2000, industry participation has been a core part of the capstone design course at Marquette University. Practicing engineers provide a relevant, practical real-world perspective of their topic, reinforcing its importance to professional engineering practice. Students and faculty benefit from the up-to-date treatment of the topic provided by guest speakers from industry who have expertise in the topic and are willing to share their experiences with students. Students benefit from industry sponsorship of senior design projects through the opportunity to work on realworld problems of importance to industry, exposure to industry and company-specific project management and product development processes, and familiarity with economic, legal, and regulatory design constraints. This paper provides a brief description of the Multidisciplinary Capstone Design course at Marquette University, examples of industry involvement in the course, and the observed benefits of industry involvement to students, the university, and industry participants.

	abstract = {The importance of internships has grown during the last decade. Internships have a lot of benefits for both, the company and the intern as well. In order to get most out of an internship, it is important that knowledge, which is related to the job assignments, is efficiently transferred to the interns. The purpose of this study is to explore the processes of knowledge transfer to the interns based on Nonoka and Takeuchi's knowledge creation model with a focus on tacit to explicit knowledge transfer.

The transfer of the required knowledge is twofold: firstly, interns must have access to already existing documents (rather explicit knowledge). Secondly, interns acquire knowledge through permanent transfer of knowledge from those who are highly experienced, like principals or workmates (rather tacit knowledge). This study used a qualitative approach to collect and analyze empirical data whereas two sources were used. In a first phase of the empirical survey a diary study with nine participants was carried out. In a following second phase semi-structured interviews with another 20 participants were conducted. The study represents the perspective of business informatics students who have to complete an internship as part of their studies.

Participants state that the best experience of their internship is based on a combination of personal support, self-reliant working and the opportunity to have access to content or knowledge management systems. An intensive training phase conducted by co-workers or previous interns is perceived positively in gaining relevant knowledge for their internship. From a qualitative perspective the support of people was ranked on the first place. The technological aspects such as knowledge management tools actively support the process of knowledge sharing.},

For the past three years, students in these courses participated in small service learning project teams and interacted with “real” clients while supervised by a faculty member of the computer science program. This sort of experiential learning helped instill a sense of social, professional and ethical responsibilities now considered so vital in the computing field.},

However, there are many skills, many life lessons, and many experiences that students can add to their repertoire in college life that are not defined as part of any particular course or courses. In this paper, we discuss things that are important in becoming a successful professional computer scientist, and how we have tried to empower our students in various areas tailored to computer science students in general, and specifically for students weak in certain areas. In particular, we discuss real-world and hands-on projects, independent study, internships, program verification, and the development of good communication, research, and social skills.},

This paper presents findings from our multi-institutional study aimed at understanding the participation of {CS} students in industry internships as well as analyzing the differences between students who intern and those who do not. We surveyed 536 {CS} undergraduate students across three universities in the United States and analyzed the quantitative data using descriptive and inferential statistical methods. We used thematic analysis on the open-ended survey responses. Overall, we found that 40\% of students participate in at least one internship. Demographically, equal proportions of males and females interned. However, we observed that students who have higher socioeconomic status were more likely to intern. Academically, there were no significant differences between students who intern and those who do not. However, through thematic analysis, we found differences regarding students’ preparation process. Interns explicitly prepared to secure internship positions by practicing interview questions and dedicating time to career preparation. Students who do not intern were less involved in the application process or relied on coursework for securing internships. Quantitative results from the survey corroborated our qualitative findings that factors outside of coursework are influencing students’ ability to secure industry internships.},

The authors develop the proposition that interactions among people, tasks, and tools are least likely to fit the new context and hence are the most difficult to transfer. This theoretical result illuminates how organizations can derive competitive advantage by transferring knowledge internally while preventing its external transfer to competitors. Because people are more similar within than between organizations, interactions involving people transfer more readily within than between firms. By embedding knowledge in interactions involving people, organizations can both effect knowledge transfer internally and impede knowledge transfer externally. Thus, knowledge embedded in the interactions of people, tools, and tasks provides a basis for competitive advantage in firms. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

In particular, we focus on self-efficacy, expected outcome, and goal mechanisms and how they may interrelate with other person (e.g., gender), contextual (e.g., support system), and experiential/learning factors. Twelve sets of propositions are offered to organize existing findings and guide future research on the theory.

	abstract = {Studies show that high-tenure displaced workers typically incur substantial long-term earnings losses. As these losses have become increasingly apparent, policy makers have significantly expanded resources for retraining, much of which takes place in regular community college classes. To analyze the effectiveness of such training, we link administrative earnings records with the community college transcript records of workers displaced from jobs during the first half of the 1990s in Washington State. We explore several issues of statistical specification for regression models quantifying the impact of community college credits on earnings. These include (i) the need to allow for a transition period immediately after the end of workers’ schooling when their earnings may be temporarily depressed, (ii) whether earnings gains are strictly proportional to credits earned, and (iii) how to model worker-specific unobserved heterogeneity. In our preferred specification, we find that the equivalent of an academic year of community college schooling raises the long-term earnings of displaced workers by an average of about 9 percent for men and about 13 percent for women. However, these average returns mask substantial variation in the returns associated with different types of courses. On the one hand, we estimate that an academic year of more technically oriented vocational and academic math and science courses raise earnings by about 14 percent for men and 29 percent for women. On the other hand, we estimate that less technically oriented courses yield very low and possibly zero returns. About one third of the increase in earnings associated with more technically oriented vocational and academic math and science courses is estimated to be due to increases in wage rates, with the remainder attributable to increased hours of work.},

	abstract = {Enrollment at America’s community colleges has exploded in recent years, with five times as many entering students today as in 1965. However, most community college students do not graduate; many earn no credits and may leave school with no more advantages in the labor market than if they had never attended. Experts disagree over the reason for community colleges’ mixed record. Is it that the students in these schools are under-prepared and ill-equipped for the academic rigors of college? Are the colleges themselves not adapting to keep up with the needs of the new kinds of students they are enrolling? In After Admission, James Rosenbaum, Regina Deil-Amen, and Ann Person weigh in on this debate with a close look at this important trend in American higher education. After Admission compares community colleges with private occupational colleges that offer accredited associates degrees. The authors examine how these different types of institutions reach out to students, teach them social and cultural skills valued in the labor market, and encourage them to complete a degree. Rosenbaum, Deil-Amen, and Person find that community colleges are suffering from a kind of identity crisis as they face the inherent complexities of guiding their students towards four-year colleges or to providing them with vocational skills to support a move directly into the labor market. This confusion creates administrative difficulties and problems allocating resources. However, these contradictions do not have to pose problems for students. After Admission shows that when colleges present students with clear pathways, students can effectively navigate the system in a way that fits their needs. The occupational colleges the authors studied employed close monitoring of student progress, regular meetings with advisors and peer cohorts, and structured plans for helping students meet career goals in a timely fashion. These procedures helped keep students on track and, the authors suggest, could have the same effect if implemented at community colleges. As college access grows in America, institutions must adapt to meet the needs of a new generation of students. After Admission highlights organizational innovations that can help guide students more effectively through higher education.},

Controlling for family income and measured ability, wage differentials for both 2-year and 4-year college credits are positive and similar. We find that the average 2-year and 4-year college student earned roughly 5\% more than similar high school graduates for every year of credits completed. Second, average bachelor and associate degree recipients did not earn significantly more than those with similar numbers of college credits and no degree, suggesting that the credentialling effects of these degree are small.

In addition to controlling for family background and ability measures, we pursue two {IV} strategies to identify measurement error and selection bias. First, we use self-reported education as an instrument for transcript reported education. Second, we use public tuition and distance from the closest 2-year and 4-year colleges as instruments, which we take as orthogonal to schooling measurement error and other unobserved characteristics of college students. Although research over the past decade has been preoccupied with selection bias, the two biases roughly cancel each other, suggesting that the results above are, if anything, understated.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the mission of the market-responsive community college. These colleges include mid- and high-level workforce training in their curriculum. Some of the characteristics of a market-responsive community college detailed here include: (1) allocating resources to develop training programs; (2) reaching out to businesses and other organizations; (3) responding rapidly to changes in local economic conditions and training needs; (4) recruiting faculty from among local experts in the field; and (5) partnering with other local educational institutions to deliver comprehensive training. Over 200 publications were reviewed for this report, and the 25 articles that contained the most relevant information, including descriptions of labor-market responsive behavior, were selected. The four methodologies used in preparing the articles that were selected were: (1) statistical analysis; (2) less formal data analysis; (3) literature reviews; and (4) anecdotal evidence. The conclusions of this review will be used as hypotheses to be thoroughly tested in the next phase of this initiative. A reading of the literature found that outsourced training expenditures for U.S. companies nearly doubled, from \$9.9 billion to \$19.3 billion annually, between 1994 and 2000. Includes brief outlines of specific community college programs and 25 annotated references to literature analyzed for the study. ({NB})},

	abstract = {While promoting postsecondary credential completion is a national priority intended to help graduates secure good jobs, the value of credentials in the labor market from the perspective of employers is not well understood. Specifically, more attention is needed to understand how credentials align with employer needs. Through in-depth interviews with managers responsible for hiring information technology technicians, we examined their perceptions of associate and bachelor’s degree holders in two contrasting labor markets: Detroit and Seattle. The study led to several key findings. First, across the two labor markets, employers expected some common qualities in both associate and bachelor’s degree holders, including technical skills and knowledge, thinking skills, communication skills, and discipline. Second, while they expected some positive qualities in associate degree holders that were distinctive to this credential, many hiring managers also expected negative characteristics, such as a lack of academic ability, initiative, or skill. However, while both associate and bachelor’s degrees provided relevant information about potential workers, employers did not expect the credentials to provide information about certain key qualities they sought in workers, including competency in customer service and teamwork, and personal interest in technology. Some of the qualities that employers expected in associate degree holders were linked to their local labor markets and their perceptions of the local community colleges. This study provides suggestions on how an understanding of the specific qualities employers expect in credential holders and of the role of the local labor market can help colleges better engage with employers and fine-tune their programs to more effectively meet students’ and employer’s needs.},

In a workforce approach, curriculum is driven by the needs of local industry, course delivery systems are sufficiently flexible to meet the diverse needs of students and industry, and students experience a mixture of work-based and classroom learning. These features combine to help students succeed at a postsecondary education and gain important training with less than a four-year degree.

The data showed that, contrary to expectations, increases in teacher effectiveness yielded greater savings than the reduction in costs associ-ated with teacher attrition. Overall, the benefit-cost analysis showed that, after 5 years, an investment of \$1 produces a positive return to society, the school district, the teachers, and the students, and the state almost recovers its expenses.

However, too few American students, especially women, pursue these fields. Although this problem has attracted enormous attention, rigorously tested interventions outside artificial laboratory settings are quite rare. To address this gap, we conducted a longitudinal field experiment investigating the effect of peer mentoring on women’s experiences and retention in engineering during college transition, assessing its impact for 1 y while mentoring was active, and an additional 1 y after mentoring had ended. Incoming women engineering students (
              n

Female (but not male) mentors protected women’s belonging in engineering, self-efficacy, motivation, retention in engineering majors, and postcollege engineering aspirations. Counter to common assumptions, better engineering grades were not associated with more retention or career aspirations in engineering in the first year of college. Notably, increased belonging and self-efficacy were significantly associated with more retention and career aspirations. The benefits of peer mentoring endured long after the intervention had ended, inoculating women for the first 2 y of college—the window of greatest attrition from science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ({STEM}) majors. Thus, same-gender peer mentoring for a short period during developmental transition points promotes women’s success and retention in engineering, yielding dividends over time.},

As a case study, we analyzed Google Summer of Code ({GSoC}), which is a three-month program that fosters students' participation in {OSS} projects. We found that 82\% of the studied {OSS} projects merged at least one students' commit in codebase. When only newcomers are considered, {\textasciitilde}54\% of {OSS} projects merged at least one commit. We also found that {\textasciitilde}23\% of newcomers started contributing to {GSoC} projects before knowing they would be accepted. We also did not find statistical difference between newcomers and students with prior participation in the projects regarding retention time after {GSoC}, except for 2015 edition. Using survival analysis, we found that {\textasciitilde}40\% of students kept contributing longer than a month, while {\textasciitilde}15\% contributed longer than a year. {OSS} communities can take advantage of our results to balance the trade-offs involved in joining this kind of program and to set expectations about how much contribution to expect and for how long students engage.},

Computer Science student interns can experience such things as real-world development environments, projects which greatly exceed the scale of typical programming assignments, the utter importance of (possibly lacking) documentation, as well as diverse languages, operating systems, and hardware. Opportunities for such internships occur rarely, however, for many rural two-year colleges, especially those geographically isolated from companies which could provide this experience. Despite such a situation at our college, we still provide students with an internship experience by creating an internal organization: the Software Development Internship ({SDI}) with the mission to develop custom software for other departments on campus. In this paper we describe the formation of the {SDI}, its activities, and some of the benefits and lessons learned to date.},

However, many question the viability of the transfer function and wonder whether students suffer a penalty for starting at a two-year institution. This paper examines how the outcomes of community college entrants compare to similar students who initially entered four-year institutions within the Ohio public higher education system. Using a detailed dataset, we track outcomes for nine years and employ multiple strategies to deal with selection issues: propensity score matching and instrumental variables. The results suggest that straightforward estimates are significantly biased, but even after accounting for selection, students who initially begin at a community college were 14.5 percent less likely to complete a bachelor's degree within nine years.},

The {AP} {CSA} course is intended to be equivalent to a college level {CS}1 course. In the fall of 2014, Sisters Rise Up 4 {CS} was also created to help female students succeed. Rise Up ({RU}) and Sisters Rise Up ({SRU}) both offer remote and in-person help sessions led by undergraduate students, who serve as near-peer role models. The long-term goal of these projects is to attract more underrepresented students to computing careers by increasing their self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is the belief that one can succeed in a particular task or field. Thanks to generous support from Google, {RU} and {SRU} have been offered at several other colleges and universities as well. This paper summarizes the results from spring 2013 to summer 2016, reports on an alumni survey answered by 68 (32\%) of the 211 alumni, and includes excerpts from five semi-structured interviews. The majority (63\%) of the alumni survey respondents, who are in college, are majoring in computing. A similar percentage of the alumni who are still in high school intend to major in computing (62\%). When asked about the programs' impact on their career choices and interest in computing, 61\% of respondents indicated that the program increased their interest in computer science and 24\% indicated that it changed their career plans to computing.},

To combat this trend, our department has made a concerted effort to revamp our introductory course sequence to both attract and retain more women and minority students. The focus of this paper is the changes instituted in our Introduction to Computer Science course (i.e., {CS}1) intended for both majors and non-majors. In addition to changing the content of the course, we introduced a new student mentoring program that is managed by a full-time coordinator and consists of undergraduate students who have recently completed the course. This paper describes these efforts in detail, including the extension of these changes to our {CS}2 course and the associated costs required to maintain these efforts. We measure the impact of these changes by tracking student enrollment and performance over 13 academic years. We show that, unlike national trends, enrollment from underrepresented groups has increased dramatically over this time period. Additionally, we show that the student mentoring program has increased both performance and retention of students, particularly from underrepresented groups, at statistically significant levels.},

At the same time, most {CS} departments across the country are only seeing 25-30\% of female students in their classes, meaning that we are failing to draw interest from a large portion of the population. In this work, we explore the gender gap in {CS} at Rutgers University using three data sets that span thousands of students across 3.5 academic years. By combining these data sets, we can explore interesting issues such as retention, as students progress through the {CS} major. For example, we find that a large percentage of women taking the Introductory {CS}1 course for majors do not intend to major in {CS}, which contributes to a large increase in the gender gap immediately after {CS}1. This finding implies that a large part of the retention task is attracting these women to further explore the major. We correlate our findings with initiatives that some {CS} programs across the country have taken to significantly improve their gender diversity, and identify initiatives that we can start with in our effort to increase the diversity in our program. These findings may also be applicable to the computing programs at other large public research universities.},

	abstract = {Novices face many barriers when learning to program a computer, including the need to learn both a new syntax and a model of computation. By constraining syntax and providing concrete visual representations on which to operate, direct manipulation programming environments can potentially lower these barriers. However, what if the ultimate learning goal of the novice is to be able to program in conventional textual languages, as is the case for introductory computer science students? Can direct manipulation programming environments lower the initial barriers to programming, and, at the same time, facilitate positive transfer to textual programming? To address this question, we designed a new direct manipulation programming interface for novices, and conducted an experimental study to compare the programming processes and outcomes promoted by the direct manipulation interface against those promoted by a textual programming interface. We found that the direct manipulation interface promoted significantly better initial programming outcomes, positive transfer to the textual interface, and significant differences in programming processes. Our results show that direct manipulation interfaces can provide novices with a “way in” to traditional textual programming.},

	abstract = {With the growing movement to use visual block-based languages ({VBBLs}) in elementary and middle school classrooms, questions arise about the learning outcomes of such activities. While some schools are content to use {VBBLs} to spark interest and motivation for the future pursuit of computing, others are asking, "Does this early exposure produce knowledge that transfers to traditional text-based languages ({TBLs})?" If transfer is a goal, then a corollary is, "How do we design the transition to maximize the transfer?" This paper focuses on initialization of state and variables, exploring the differences between Scratch and two {TBLs}: C and Java. Based on observations of 9-12 year old students in a {VBBL} curriculum, we identify four "pieces of knowledge" that are critical for C and Java but are not nearly as obvious in Scratch, including whether, when, and how to perform initialization. We conclude with suggestions for instruction and development environment that may improve transfer.},

	abstract = {We present here an empirical study comparing the accuracy rates of novices writing software in three programming languages: Quorum, Perl, and Randomo. The first language, Quorum, we call an evidence-based programming language, where the syntax, semantics, and {API} designs change in correspondence to the latest academic research and literature on programming language usability. Second, while Perl is well known, we call Randomo a Placebo-language, where some of the syntax was chosen with a random number generator and the {ASCII} table. We compared novices that were programming for the first time using each of these languages, testing how accurately they could write simple programs using common program constructs (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions, variables, parameters). Results showed that while Quorum users were afforded significantly greater accuracy compared to those using Perl and Randomo, Perl users were unable to write programs more accurately than those using a language designed by chance.},

	abstract = {Blocks-based programming environments are becoming increasingly common in introductory programming courses, but to date, little comparative work has been done to understand if and how this approach affects students' emerging understanding of fundamental programming concepts. In an effort to understand how tools like Scratch and Blockly differ from more conventional text-based introductory programming languages with respect to conceptual understanding, we developed a set of "commutative" assessments. Each multiple-choice question on the assessment includes a short program that can be displayed in either a blocks- based or text-based form. The set of potential answers for each question includes the correct answer along with choices informed by prior research on novice programming misconceptions. In this paper we introduce the Commutative Assessment, discuss the theoretical and practical motivations for the assessment, and present findings from a study that used the assessment. The study had 90 high school students take the assessment at three points over the course of the first ten weeks of an introduction to programming course, alternating the modality (blocks vs. text) for each question over the course of the three administrations of the assessment. Our analysis reveals differences on performance between blocks-based and text-based questions as well as differences in the frequency of misconceptions based on the modality. Future work, potential implications, and limitations of these findings are also discussed.},
