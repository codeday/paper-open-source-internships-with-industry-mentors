\section{Conclusions}

This experience report presented our model for an open-source internship, provided over two years to 311 students, most of whom had no prior internships and who were less likely to secure a traditional one.

We reviewed week-by-week mentor evaluations which showed that most students entering the program were lacking in most areas needed to find employment, but that by the end they had dramatically improved in both technical proficiency --- which would likely grow as they took more classes --- and their ability to independently develop software and work with peers --- which has usually required a traditional internship.

Finally, using follow-up data we saw that students who participated were more likely than average to find full-time employment or paid internships after the program.

Overall, our experience showed that an open source internship program can provide positive outcomes similar to traditional internships, and help more students start their career in technology.
