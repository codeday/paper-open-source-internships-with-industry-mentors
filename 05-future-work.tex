\section{Future Work}

In future years we plan to grow the number of students participating in the program, which is limited by our capacity to recruit volunteers and students. We welcome collaborators from industry and open-source communities who can aid in recruiting more volunteer mentors, and colleges who are interested in providing this opportunity to their students.

Another limitation to growth is the capacity of program staff to resolve issues with individual students. Most issues involved students not managing their time correctly, and we plan to require students to commit to a specific working schedule, to include this availability in matchmaking, and to enforce the schedule with time-tracking.  The propensity of students to overestimate their skills likely also contributes to these issues, and we intend to explore ways to narrow the gap by setting realistic standards and providing increased training.

Finally, the current matching system likely allows students too much latitude in the selection of projects, as evidenced by mentors rating 36\% of students as not a good fit for their project. Further research is needed to determine if students are simply misinformed by project descriptions, or are selecting projects which are too far outside their abilities due to ambition.
