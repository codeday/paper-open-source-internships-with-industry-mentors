\section{introduction}

Computer science coursework provides students with the fundamental skills to learn what they need to know later in their careers, but many colleges engage industry to show students how to apply what they learn. \cite{beaubouefComputerScienceCurriculum2011} Industry engagement can come in many forms – including mentoring, guest speakers, tours, case studies, and capstone projects – but one of the most significant predictors of student success is participation in an internship. \cite{callananAssessingRoleInternships2004}

In this report, we describe an open-source internship, which we define as an industry engagement experience in which students work on a new or existing software project, licensed under an open-source license, with the guidance of an experienced software engineer.

Compared to internships where students work on proprietary software, open-source internships do not require access to corporate resources or inure to the exclusive benefit of a company. While some programs have explored paid mentors, \cite{silvaStudentsEngagementOpen2017} our program used volunteer mentors exclusively. Our hope was the low resource investment would allow us to provide an internship experience to students who were otherwise unlikely to have one.
